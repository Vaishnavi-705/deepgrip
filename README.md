A ensemble model for image forgery detection using transfer learning.
The volume of photos generated has increased dramatically in the last decade as a result of technological advancements and easy access to the Internet.The authenticity of these photos must be guaranteed because they have such a huge impact on people's lives and are sometimes used as evidence in the investigation of serious crimes. Image fraud must be detected in order to protect the imageâ€™s integrity and legitimacy. To create fabricated images, Deep Fakes, copy-move forgery, picture splicing, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and other methods are used. Most forgery detection approaches and detectors are focused on only one sort of fraud, whether computer- or human-generated, and little progress has been made in constructing robust detectors that can successfully and efficiently deal with various types of forgery.
